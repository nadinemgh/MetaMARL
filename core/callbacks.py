"""RLlib hooks used by the inner optimizer.

Three pieces live here. ``tag_episode_with_env_idx`` is an
``on_episode_created`` callback that stamps each episode ID with the identity
of the sub-environment that produced it, which is how the ``policy_mapping_fn``
in ``RayOptimizerConfig`` picks the right RLModule.
``log_and_report_episode_metrics`` is an episode-end callback that flushes the
environment's metric logger to its reporter and into RLlib's
``MetricsLogger``. ``_evaluate_with_fixed_duration_once`` is a
``custom_evaluation_function`` that replaces RLlib's fixed-duration evaluation
loop with a strict single round.

    """Rewrite the episode ID to carry the sub-environment identity.

    Registered as ``callbacks(on_episode_created=...)`` on the new API stack.
    The ID becomes ``"env=<i>|m=<mech>|ps=<policy_seed>|ss=<seed>|raw=<id>"``
    where ``i`` is the vector index of the sub-environment in its runner,
    ``mech`` the mechanism candidate index, ``policy_seed`` the seed of the
    RLModule that should act, ``seed`` the environment dynamics seed, and
    ``raw`` RLlib's original random ID (kept so the ID stays unique).

    Why go through the episode ID: on the new API stack the
    ``policy_mapping_fn`` only receives ``(agent_id, episode)``, with no
    direct handle on the environment instance, so the environment's identity
    has to be smuggled into the episode itself. Encoding it in the ID also
    makes the mapping visible in logs and metrics. IDs already starting with
    ``env=`` are left untouched.

    Parameters
    ----------
    episode : MultiAgentEpisode
        Freshly created episode whose ``id_`` is rewritten in place.
    env_runner : MultiAgentEnvRunner
        Runner owning the vectorised environment; the sub-env is fetched as
        ``env_runner.env.envs[env_index].unwrapped``.
    env : VectorMultiAgentEnv
        Vector env passed by RLlib; immediately shadowed by the unwrapped
        sub-environment and otherwise unused.
    env_index : int
        Position of the sub-environment in the vector env.
    **kwargs
        Other callback arguments, ignored.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If the sub-environment has no ``mechanism_id`` or ``seed`` (they must
        be injected by the env creator), or if its ``env_id`` was already set
        to a different index. ``policy_seed`` is read without such a check.

    Notes
    -----
    Side effect: on the first episode the sub-environment's ``env_id`` is set
    to ``env_index``; ``EnvStepContext.env_id`` is ``None`` before that.

def _evaluate_with_fixed_duration_once(algo, eval_env_runner_group):
    """Evaluate for exactly ``evaluation_duration`` units in a single round.

    Adapted from RLlib's ``Algorithm._evaluate_with_fixed_duration``. Used as
    ``custom_evaluation_function`` so that, with one evaluation env runner per
    ``(train seed, eval seed)`` and one sub-environment per mechanism, every
    ``(mechanism, policy seed, eval seed)`` triple is rolled out exactly once.

    Differences from the RLlib original, all on the new API stack path:

    - The remaining units are split across healthy runners once and the loop
      exits after that round instead of iterating until the duration is met.
    - If fewer results than healthy runners come back within
      ``evaluation_sample_timeout_s``, a ``RuntimeError`` is raised rather
      than re-issuing the work to other runners. Redistribution would
      evaluate some triples twice and others never, biasing the fitness the
      regulator computes from the published step contexts.
    - If the units completed differ from ``evaluation_duration``, a
      ``RuntimeError`` is raised instead of another round being started.
    - Evaluation metrics are read back with ``latest_merged_only=True`` so
      only this call's results are returned.
    - Three values are returned (the public ``custom_evaluation_function``
      contract) instead of the five the private RLlib method returns.

    The old API stack branch is kept as in RLlib and is not exercised by this
    project.

    Parameters
    ----------
    algo : Algorithm
        The algorithm being evaluated; supplies the evaluation config.
    eval_env_runner_group : EnvRunnerGroup
        Group of evaluation env runners to sample from.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[dict, int, int]
        ``(eval_results, env_steps, agent_steps)`` where ``eval_results`` is
        the ``EVALUATION_RESULTS`` subtree of the metrics logger.

    Raises
    ------
