"""Type aliases shared across the framework.

The aliases name the identifiers that flow between the ``World``, the
optimizers and the environments (``ContextID``, ``OptimizerID``) and the
container types exchanged with RLlib (``EnvType``, ``EnvConfigDict``). They
carry no runtime behaviour.

Unique identifier for a context object.

Used to distinguish different context schemas stored in a World

Unique identifier for an optimizer instance.

Used to:
- Namespace contexts inside a World
- Associate contexts with producing optimizers
- Support parent/child or upstream/downstream optimizer graphs

OptimizerIDs are expected to be stable for the lifetime of an experiment.
