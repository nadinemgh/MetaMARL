def override(parent_cls: type) -> Callable[[F], F]:
    """Decorator for documenting method overrides.

    Parameters
    ----------
    parent_cls : type
        The superclass that provides the overridden method.

    Returns
    -------
    callable
        A decorator that returns the decorated method unchanged after checking
        that ``parent_cls`` exposes an attribute with the same name.

    Raises
    ------
    NameError
        If ``parent_cls`` has no attribute named like the decorated method.

    Notes
    -----
    Only the name check is effective. The inner ``OverrideCheck`` descriptor is
    meant to verify, through ``__set_name__``, that the owning class is a
    subclass of ``parent_cls``. However ``decorator`` returns the original
    ``method`` rather than the ``OverrideCheck`` instance, so the descriptor is
    never bound to the class and ``__set_name__`` never runs. The subclass
    check is therefore dead code and no ``TypeError`` is raised when the owning
    class is unrelated to ``parent_cls``.
